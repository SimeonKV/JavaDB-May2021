00. Create Database
You now know how to create database using the GUI of the Workbench. 
Now it's time to create it using SQL queries. In that task (and the several following it)
you will be required to create the database from the previous exercise using only SQL queries. 
Firstly, just create new database named minions.


QUERY ->>> 
CREATE DATABASE `minions`;




01.Create Tables
In the newly created database Minions add table minions (id, name, age). 
Then add new table towns (town_id, name). Set id and town_id columns of both tables to be primary key as constraint, 
id's must be auto increment. Submit yours create table queries in Judge together for both tables (one after another separated by ";") 
as Run queries & check DB.


QUERY ->>> 
USE `minions`;

CREATE TABLE `minions`(
`id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
`age` INT 
);


CREATE TABLE `towns`(
`town_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL
);
